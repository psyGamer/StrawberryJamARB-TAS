All Red Berries, the main project, is getting every single red berry collectible around every level in the Strawberry Jam mod.
<br>Max% on the other hand, is maximizing the total berry count to it's highest possible level. ARB in SJ doesn't include certain types of berries.

The berries Max% collects are as follows:
<br>Red Berries - The standard berry collectible you can find laying around most of the levels.
<br>Silver Berries - Individual collab level's deathless berry. Just like a golden in maingame, if you touch it you have to beat a level without dying. Not only do you have to route around picking up the silver berry, but also around removing any deathwarps or similar problems. A level's silver berry only gets unlocked after beating the level once before.
<br>Rainbow Berries - A secret bonus collectible found in every single lobby. Once you beat every individual collab level in a select lobby with their silver berries, the rainbow gets unlocked and is collectible on the overworld. There are 5 rainbow berries, one per lobby, and there is extra effort that goes into finding an optimal lobby route that picks it up after getting every silver and then goes to the heartside.
<br>Golden Berries - Works exactly the same as any maingame golden, you pick it up and you have to beat the level without dying. These are used for the Heartsides at the end of each lobby. A Heartside's Golden Berry only gets unlocked after beating the level once before.

To separate the file names in Max% from the ARB level filenames, the _S and _G suffixes are used for Silvers and Goldens respectively.
<br>If the red berries are split up between a normal run and a silver run, then the _S0 and _S1 suffixes are used instead. These refer to an initial red berries run that gets most - but not all - of the red berries, and a 2nd silver deathless run with the remaining red berry/berries respectively.
