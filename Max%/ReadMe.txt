All Red Berries, the main project, is getting every single red berry collectible around every level in the Strawberry Jam mod.
Max% on the other hand, is maximizing the total berry count to it's highest possible level. ARB in SJ doesn't include certain types of berries.

The berries Max% collects are as follows:
Red Berries - The standard berry collectible you can find laying around most of the levels.
Silver Berries - Individual collab level's deathless berry. Just like a golden in maingame, if you touch it you have to beat a level without dying. Not only do you have to route around picking up the silver berry, but also around removing any deathwarps or similar problems. A level's silver berry only gets unlocked after beating the level once before.
Rainbow Berries - A secret bonus collectible found in every single lobby. Once you beat every individual collab level in a select lobby with their silver berries, the rainbow gets unlocked and is collectible on the overworld. There are 5 rainbow berries, once per lobby.
Golden Berries - Every Heartside has a golden, exactly the same as any maingame golden, you pick it up and you die. A Heartside's Golden Berry only gets unlocked after beating the level once before.

To separate the file names in Max% from the ARB level filenames, the _S and _G suffixes are used for Silvers and Goldens respectively.
